DWMST
=====

**Forked from TrilbyWhite's dwmStatus:** https://github.com/TrilbyWhite/dwmStatus

A great inspiration for many code optimizations has been OK100. Thanks!
The last rewrite also took major inspiration and code from Suckless.

This is a hardcoded statusbar for my system and, like Trilby's dwmStatus from which this is forked, it was not meant to be flexible.  Flexibility costs memory and processor time. This can, however, be used as a template for your own status bar app.
