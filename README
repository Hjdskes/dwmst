FORKED FROM TRILBY WHITE'S DWMSTATUS: https://github.com/TrilbyWhite/dwmStatus

This is a hardcoded statusbar for my system and, like Trilby's dwmStatus on which this is forked, it was not meant to be flexible.  Flexibility costs memory and processor time. This can, however, be used as a template for your own status bar app.

Note that this was written to work with the statuscolors patch. The colors are int format strings of the sprintf commands. However, as they are mostly nonprintable they can show up oddly, or not at all, depending on your editor. To remove the dependecy on statuscolors simply remove these characters from the format strings.

PS: Audio information is retrieved from a file in my home directory.
This file is updated by whenever the volume is changed by my XF86Vol* keybindings.
This is much more efficient that querying the actual volume from alsa every second.
